# Watch trade network

> This is an interactive, distributed, watch trade demo. It is an omichannel distributed marketplace where both the first and second-hand sales of timepieces are conducted. 
- The first-hand watches can be purchased by collectors who place orders directly  to manufacturer, without the need for any middle man. 
- Second-hand purchases and sales are enabled for the "blockchain proof" watches that have been previously added in the network, by the manufacturer. The second-hand sales take place through auction. Once again without the need for any mddle man to match bid and offer as well as guaranteeing trust between the parties.
- A courier is also involved in both first and second hand transactions having the joint authority, shared with the collector and the manufacturer, to update the delivery status of the phisical items. Once approved the pasyment will be credited to the seller's wallet, the courier paid and the ownership changed.
